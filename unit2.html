                    Before I learnt  about coding a laptop to me was used for in my house for Football Manager or the Internet however since I have discovered such tools as Trello for example I have downloaded it for my mobile phone where I am able to work away from the laptop, having now the skills to use Trello I am able to pick out the ideas in my head instantly jot something down and come back to it later.  Code Nation has changed how I see Technology and how I can apply Technology better when skills have been learnt or even through trial and error, with Trello I used the "Kanban" method as a logical way of thinking not just in coding but also everyday life.  Things to do, things doing, things done this is the Kanban method I am happy to of leant this because during the activity to create a text based adventure game in a group, explaining my ideas sometimes was hard when I used Trello talking about ideas was easier. Trello wil be a useful too for me to use to create websites by throwing all my ideas into one setting and bringing ideas to life.

                <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
                <p class="boarderP">
                    In my opinion I couldn't of told anyone what IT tools to buy and use to create a website page so with that in mind I can only speak of what Code Nation taught me.  In order for me to aquire these skills I needed access to a computer and Internet, I was given Software links from Code Nation to access the learning material.  It allowed me to work from home having access to the Internet helped me to interact with mentors through the use of Zoom a video conference platform giving multiple users at once the chance to communicate without having to book appointments or leave there enviroment to see that person.  For me to create web pages I was taught how to operate Visual Sudio Code, a tool for programming.  This web page was created using Visual Studio Code and Internet access nothing else, having the use of Slack as another communication tool was good to have as that gave me a platform to share snippets of code to mentors and colleagues to see where changes can be made.

                    In the about me section, I said I will look back at my first web page from behind the sofa and I mean every word of it! Because the pros and cons of the final project is that I never done anything like this before can't expect my first attempt to be perfect, however coming back to my first web page will always be a good tool to start from.  Originally I wanted to add sound effects to my web page when the users clicks on a button a sound effect would happen but then I decided against it because the time needed to incorporate that into my web page I just didnt make it a top priority, with that in mind this web page could be very much different if more time was given.  I also wanted to spend more to time on CSS creating and designing layouts and more fun stuff to do.

                <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
            <p class="boarderP"> 
                The next page and previous page link originally the idea was to have the option to click on a button within the nav bar to take the user to the designated page but then I thought about using an alternative way to get all the information on one page at once giving the user the same option to click on a link to another section.  I think researching as much as possible about the tools needed to be used, would enhance my ability greatly to work at a much quicker pace because I am more used to having a Playstation 4 controller pad in my hands or a mobile phone than eight or more hours a day using a laptop to write a web page.  Researching is important because when explainig a code to another person who understands coding, is much easier when you researched to know enough to ask for help.  When I decide to make further improvements I be looking for the answers myself but also bring other people in to help improve the page with there expertise.  I would want to make my own tutorial videos and put them on my web page and give a social media outlet from my page too I think that would be good.

            <p class="boarderP">
                After completing my web page I intend to continue to find more ways to create better web pages, I have already downloaded Code Academy on my mobile phone usually when I have five or ten minutes I use that time to practise code or read about stuff I was taught by Code Nation just to keep the coding fresh in my mind.  Coming back to my first web page will come in handy because altough I be finding ways to make it better I be still using the skills taught. Code Nation provided me slides and course work material over the last three weeks that I can look back on and work on those projects I also can keep in touch with Code Nation to see if any events may be happening that may suit my taste.

                My understanding of copyright if I written a song, recorded it and then took it to the bank to insure it as my original work I would have the proof the material was created by me and a time and date can be seen as the material is with my chosen bank<a href="https://copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p05_copyright_infringement">[7].</a> Let's say someone used my material they would be liable for me to take to court for taking my work and declaring it as there own work however if I never time stamped my work by recording it or saving it plus giving my material to the bank, the person who used my material would benefit and I would not.  British law does not require someone to register their right to any original material they have created.

                Technology is always changing finding more ways to improve itself a website is an online marketing tool businesses who invest time and energy into making there website user friendly will gain more customers because Technology is going to continue to find ways to overcome impossibilities leaving developers little room to not have tools to make websites more user friendly<a href="https://thenextscoop.com disability-friendly-user-experience/">[10].</a><a href="https://thenextscoop.com/traffic-generating-video-content/">[11]</a>   If the user is unable to display an image a alternative text would be in the image place<a href="https://yoast.com/image-seo-alt-tag-and-title-tag-optimization/">[12].</a>  If the user was to watch a video and is deaf or hard of hearing, provide captions whether spoken or in written text to make watching a video accessible, subtitles must be given to understand a video in any language there is a difference between captions and subtitles to be user friendly. If the user using a website is visually impaired give a descriptive text properly explaining the content links, for example if you are pointing visitors to a page called "About Us": Try not to say "click here to read about our company". Instead say "To learn more about our company read About us"<a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/youtube-closed-captioning-for-accessibility-why-and-how">[13].</a>   Take into account the user may be affected by colour blindness which can affect the user from understanding what is been displayed the most common to be red and green.  People who have other disabilities can greatly benefit from colours, the developer should understand when creating a website to use an asterisk or question mark to distinguish blocks of content from one another using visual separation (such as white space or borders)<a href="https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility">[14].</a>

            <h2>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
            <p class="boarderP">
                For me personally, there are many different filetypes for websites<a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html#html">[15].</a>   I will be using HTML which is the platform used to create web pages.  I have decided on fonts style and sizes for each of my headings and paragraphs, that been said CSS is used to style web pages.  I do intend to have pictures on my site however I have decided on JPEG rather than JPG because of the quality of image and also the many variants colour options.  Because I mentioned the use of images they be no GIF as I think it would be distracting to the reader and also I thought about maybe lagging problems.  I have also thought about using a sound effect to my web page to use sound I would opt to use MP3 file because of quality.  There maybe a need for me write a letter I would then use a WORD document to provide me with the tools to do the tasks.  When it comes to appropriate file types used for websites these tools all have a job to do in IT which allows the screen reader to see the website with different font sizes in different colours, and images all can be viewed and clicked onto for accessibility.
