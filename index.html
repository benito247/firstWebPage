                My name is Benito Hylton and this is my first web page, it should be an achievement in creating a web page, I know in years to come. I will come back to my first web page and hide behind the sofa. Before Code Nation I was working as a CCTV Security Guard prior to doing that I was on construction sites as a Labourer where I learnt Wall and Floor Tiler as a trade. My work experience has good customer service skills as with creative skills too, when I was in high school me and my friends would DJ on pirate radio stations to practise our styles of presentation and how we would work the crowd, same weekend we go onto playing music in nightclubs, even back then I was expressing myself through creative arts of some kind. I was always drawing artwork, creating pictures. I could'nt put a basketball down always practising, even when onto playing for numerous of clubs during my educational days I took Music, Art, Sport, as part of my G.C.S.E.s.
