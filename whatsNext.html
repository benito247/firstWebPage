            Well, I would like to continue to study to become a Software Developer. I am interested in finding a Master Coding Course. I would like to understand Javascript, HTML and CSS more and other tools. I would like to gain more qualifications and potential employment as I can't see myself going back to my old job as a Security Guard. I like to thank Code Nation for all there support and thank you for reading my first web page. I intend to upload my work on Git Hub and stay in touch with Code Nation.
