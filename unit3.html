        <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and
            efficiency</h2>
    <p class="boarderP">
        I feel if I was able to access Code Nation physically instead of virtually then it might of suited me more because the learning style would of been different for me as I would of proberly asked for help more in class rather than at home, I researched more than I might of because I didn't know about coding and if i was in Code Nation I could ask for some help.  Learning from home has its drawbacks been distracted easily by working at home is tough, it's easy to switch off so staying motivated is a good skill to develop. When Code Nation trusted me with the tools to create a web page I did'nt know how difficult the first week was going to be so I had to work hard by researching and testing everything I was taught by doing it myself and hoping to fix errors without asking for the answer without knowing how they fixed it. But the by week two I discovered more about myself that I was challenge myself by learning something new, working in a group setting I was able to share my thoughts and work and come across abit more better because I took the time to research the task at the time, I think team work is always better than working alone of course depending on the project I feel I contribute efficently in a team and when working alone projects get done when im not distracted.

        <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <p class="boarderP">
        I mentioned about if I was able to go to Code Nation to study then the learning styles would of been different, the Code Nation in Manchester City Centre would of given me more options to take breaks for inspirational thoughts I could of walked to grab a coffee from Starbucks or bought lunch from KFC and still access my work from my own laptop for example.  Also at Code Nation they offer Yoga once a week to relieve stress and discomforts this is a great way to improve productivity as sitting at a desk for hours and the use of Technology can be stressful at times, before I joined Code Nation I didn't practise Reiki as much It's my seventh year this year a Level Two Reiki Practitioner and before coding I thought about becoming a Reiki Master getting insured and then offering my services by setting up my own business, now I just give self treatment to improve efficiency and productivity to get the best results from me.  I found talking helps, when I was faced with a difficult task I got quite annoyed I tried really hard to understand it but all what happened is I went deeper down the rabbit hole, I spoke to my mentor Jay and told him I wanted to quit and he did'nt talk me out of it we spoke on Google Hangout in a one to one and it helped me understand that by telling someone my problem I was able to see the problem from another stand point and I overcame that hurdle by asking for help.

        <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
    <p class="boarderP">
        Before Code Nation I was used to working as a CCTV Security Guard sixty hours a week was sometimes very difficult other times easy, when it comes to Technology I think having adequate rests periods are very helpful my partner told me to take a break on week one I took offence at the time as I was working very hard, but that is just it!  I was working too hard and needed a break, and a fresh perspective as this helped increase my productivity from that daay forward.  Exercising is also a great way to relieve stress in the body. Having a "me time", I would say is a good way to work alongside Technology the strain on the back, wrists, neck, hips, eyes I could go on but just having fifteen minutes away is a great benefit.  From now on I use Reiki as my tool to help me relieve stress and think more clearly.

        <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <p class="boarderP">
        I have really appreciated learning about thinking of ways a web page can be user friendly for me I would go back to all my coursework content and go over them and test run activitys where I didn't have enough time to complete on that day.  I can also continue to build on the text based adventure game to broaden my knowledge and skills.
