            <h2>Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2> 
            <p class="boarderP">
                In my opinion, I think the purpose of Information Technology is to improve the quality of all of life. In modern businesses communication, point of sale, data management systems, customer relationship management are to name a few of how IT can help companies maintain and go forward in society<a href="https://www.1training.org/importance-information-technology-modern-working-places">[1].</a>In today's society a business may find it difficult to market there product without the use of Technology, it's a valuable part of every office and business environment<a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/information-technology-its-role-modern-organization-1800.html">[2].</a>

            <h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully  what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
            <p class="boarderP">
                My answer will be based on my three weeks develop coding course with Codenation. In a small team we had to create a text based adventure game. To make the project successful certain tools were used to complete the activity. Visual Studio Code enables the user to create virtually anything for the web. I used Slack as a communication tool to keep in contact with group members about the project in hand, things like setting up a team channel to share ideas and give help where needed. Also Google Hangouts was used for stand ups for face to face conversations, and to show the user screen to offer help if needed or to present a slide. Having a basic understanding of the use of a computer is a good start for the use of tools mentioned. I suppose having a logical mind is a skill that can be applied to the use of IT. Having good listening and speaking skills will be a factor on the video platform too. Managing time effectively and efficiently is best practise especially when working to a project deadline.

                <p class="boarderP">
                    I plan to research how to build a website using the internet to see different ways I can create my website portfolio. I intend to use Trello to create a things to do, things doing, and things completed. That way I am able to create an idea and change the idea or even swap ideas around to see how they all fit into place before creating the site. I intend to research about the use of HTML & CSS as they will be part of how to build my site, I need a theme for my site where I am showing a side of my personality and I am interested in using a special effect sound on my site when clicking on something to open. I have to incorporate an section about me and possibly a picture of myself. I also plan to research different styles of my presentation on how much or little to display and do I want to have one page of information or many pages, also I would like to have a reference list where I have the material links from the research I did, here is my <a href="https://trello.com/b/1dUxYjjb/website-ideas">Trello board</a> that way I can show you my ideas on each phase of how I created my site.

                <h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
            <p class="boarderP">
                In my opinion I think that when it comes to why digital projects fail miscommunication from the top of the management right down to the bottom of the workforce can be a hinderance to the project I feel that having communication platforms and ways to keep in touch to send and show project instructions can be beneficial. I also feel that the team size can be a factor too, as trying to do all the work at once or not been able to complete the work to a deadline can be a considerable factor. Failing to plan ahead with things like budget planning ie overspending would cause a digital project to fail.  Depending on the project I would research the tools needed to complete the tasks to the best of my ability.

                    <h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
                <p class="boarderP">
                        If you remember Unit One.One the question asked "What tools do you need to make a project successful?". I mentioned some systems earlier on that now I will elaborate on more to answer this question. For me personally I feel having a communication platform to engage with management and staff. Technology such as Slack would make work life easier to communicate with colleagues, of course the use of email is still viable just Slack brings the use of writing alive by having more options than email, let's say we wanna send a email to multiple people usually it's "cc" add how many people send email. Where as Slack same method applies we can create a channel add colleagues who have access to the channel to private chat send attachments and more. This could be used for meetings and various other tasks, quick and instant instead of waiting for a reply back from an email sent ages ago <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/features">[3].</a>
                        I think companies generally have a in house system the Intranet is an data management system that gives a platform to access all company information, directories to sites and web documents. We can access training programs and give access to Human Resource or Management things like staff holidays. The Intranet can be tailored to company identity and can be incorporated in many other ways than mentioned <a href="https://www.happeo.com/what-is-intranet ">[4].</a> Customer Relationship Management is an software that records customers details such as name, address, date of birth, telephone number, customer preferences and more. This software can do the same for businesses we can add staff information how well team members perform, how well company products have been sold. Management and sales teams can look at all data and see where to invest more time and energy, potential company mergers is possible from all data recorded, planned and executed.<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/learning-centre/crm/what-is-crm">[5]</a> These are a few business Technologies I would go about selecting and using IT to start up and run a business.

                    <p class="boarderP">
                        I had no prior knowledge of coding or how to create a website I had to use the Technologies provided to me by Code Nation where I joined a three week develop coding course, I worked from home and all I had was a hyper optic broadband and a windows laptop. Code Nation sent me direct links to Technological platforms that would enabled me from home to create this website here for you to read from.  These developer tools, Visual studio code, Zoom, Slack as well as content talks from Code Nation mentors helped me to complete my proudest achievement so far in coding which is creating a text based adventure game. With Github version control I can work on projects offline and contribute to team projects too, before Github I would send zip files of my work to colleagues now I have a Github account I can upload my work and it be the up to date version I like Github. Git is something I will look at in the future.

                        General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). New data protection legislation is coming into force in May 2018 which aims to protect peopleâ€™s privacy further. The new law applies to all public bodies, businesses and other organisations that process personal data. The legislation comprises the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which comes into force on 25 May 2018 and the new Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 which will come into force around the same time. This will provide a single regulation across the European Union (EU) and place obligations on organisations that operate outside of the EU but provide goods or services to EU citizens.<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intellectual-property-office-privacy-notices/gdpr-compliance-statement">[6]</a>
